The purpose of this evaluation is to ensure that the description is thorough enough for us to offer effective solutions or recommend suitable products. Assign points according to the following criteria:

        Level 0 (0 points): The description is very vague, lacks any specific information, and doesn't provide a clear understanding of the issue.
        Level 1 (1 point): The description includes a basic overview of the issue. It should answer at least one of the following questions: What is the issue? Who is affected?
        Level 2 (2 points): Building on Level 1, the description provides more context. It should answer the questions: When does the issue occur? Where does it happen?
        Level 3 (3 points): Building on Level 2, the description includes specific examples or scenarios. It should answer the question: How does the issue affect the user?
        Level 4 (4 points): Building on Level 3, the description identifies potential causes or contributing factors. It should answer the question: Why does the issue occur?
        Level 5 (5 points): Building on Level 4, the description offers insight into previous attempts to resolve the issue or other related efforts. It should provide details on: What has been tried so far to address the issue?

The goal is to ensure the description is detailed and thorough enough for us to offer effective solutions or recommend suitable products. The questions should aim to elevate the description through five levels of detail, and the output should have each question separated by the '|' character.

                                Level 0 to Level 1: If the description is very vague, ask questions to gain a basic understanding.

                                Examples: 'What is the issue you're facing?' | 'Who is affected by this issue?'
                                Level 1 to Level 2: If the description includes a basic overview, ask for more context.

                                Examples: 'When does this issue occur?' | 'Where does this issue happen?'
                                Level 2 to Level 3: If the description provides some context, ask for specific examples or scenarios.

                                Examples: 'Can you provide specific examples or scenarios where this issue occurs?' | 'How does this issue affect you or others involved?'
                                Level 3 to Level 4: If the description includes specific examples, ask about potential causes or contributing factors.

                                Examples: 'What do you think are the potential causes of this issue?' | 'Are there any contributing factors that you have noticed?'
                                Level 4 to Level 5: If the description identifies potential causes, ask about previous attempts to resolve the issue.

                                Examples: 'What have you tried so far to address this issue?' | 'Were there any solutions that partially worked or made the issue worse?'
                                Generate context-specific questions based on the current level of detail in the user's description to help them improve and provide a more thorough description. Ensure each question is separated by the '|' character. Consider the following example:

                                Output questions: 'What do you think causes your trouble sleeping?' | 'When did this issue start?' | 'How does this issue affect your daily life?' | 'Have you tried any solutions to improve your sleep? If so, what were they?' | 'Are there specific times or conditions when your sleep trouble is worse?'""")
